# Gapminder-scotland
A Gapminder like visualization on top of Scottish health data

Data should be in "data/Deprivation_20180313_raw_data.csv" 

There's two different python files, each of them with a different visualization 

For this to work you need to install holoviews and bokeh 

To run: "bokeh serve --show Gapminder_Scotland.py"
